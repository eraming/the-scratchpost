# the ScratchPost

[Demo](http://the-scratchpost.herokuapp.com/)

**The ScratchPost** is a version 1.0 MERN prototype single page web app for editing and re-arranging digital cards or "beats" in a screenplay. Lo-fi without the bells and whistles of pay-to-play software. 

Based on kickstartcoding's [react-MERN-prototyping-starter](https://github.com/kickstartcoding/react-mern-prototyping-starter) and front-end built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**DO NOT** use this project in production. It exposes an API to MongoDB without
any sort of security. For prototype purposes only.

## Back End
Backend is a nodejs express server that provides REST API access to backend data stored in MongoDB.

### NPM Components
The following npm components and dependencies were used:

| Component             | Version    |
| --------------------- |:----------:|
|react                  | ^16.12.0   |
|kc-react-widgets       | ^1.0.5     |
|react-router-dom       | ^5.1.2     |
|array-move             | ^2.2.1     |
|react-tabs             | ^3.1.0     |



## Database
Database is provided by MongoDB.

## Future Development

As of now, card information is seperate from Project title. Future development will connect card content to project names and can be sorted by Acts. We intend to add to our current features by incorporating [React Drag and Drop](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about) and [Copy to Clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-copy-to-clipboard).
