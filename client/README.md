# MERN Prototyping Starter

This is an example start project for [Kickstart
Coding](http://kickstartcoding.com/) MERN MVP projects.

**DO NOT** use this project in production. It exposes an API to MongoDB without
any sort of security. The only purpose of the API is to allow rapid front-end
prototyping without much (or any) backend modifications.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
